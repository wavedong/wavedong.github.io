## New KRACK Attack Against Wi-Fi Encryption

-  New KRACK Attack Against Wi-Fi Encryption Mathy Vanhoef has just published a devastating attack against WPA2, the 14-year-old encryption protocol used by pretty much all wi-fi systems

- Its an interesting attack, where the attacker forces the protocol to reuse a key

- The authors call this attack KRACK, for Key Reinstallation Attacks This is yet another of a series of marketed attacks; with a cool name, a website, and a logo

- The QA on the website answers a lot of questions about the attack and its implications

- And lots of good information in this ArsTechnica article. There is an Tom Wimmenhove has discovered a vulnerability in the key fob system used by several Subaru vehicles

- By exploiting the vulnerability, a thief can clone a key fob and gain access to a vehicle with relative ease

- Wimmenhove says he informed Subaru of the security flaw but was not taken seriously and the issue has not been patched. The key fob sends out a code which the car interprets to unlock the doors

- Typically these codes are randomized to prevent hackers from reusing a previous code, but Subaru's implementation is flawed

- By capturing a single packet from a working key fob, the attacker can use Wimmenhove's code to predict the next rolling code and unlock the car

- He has nicknamed this the fobrob exploit.  Creating the device is

- As a proof of concept, Wimmenhove executed the script on his phone and used a Wi-Fi dongle, a TV dongle, and a 433MHz antenna

- The software can run on a Raspberry Pi and the antennas cost just a few dollars

- Six days after Patch-Tuesday-that-wasnt, Adobe has released an out-of-band patch for Flash in response to a zero-day vulnerability thats being exploited in the wild.

- This Flash vulnerability, CVE-2017-11292, could allow remote code execution, and is rated as Critical

- It affects Flash both in browsers and on desktop players, on Windows, Mac, Linux, and Chrome OS.

- Adobe notes that this vulnerability is being exploited in the wild, specifically by a criminal group that has previously used other Flash vulnerabilities to carry out their attacks.

## The Flawed System Behind the Krack Wi-Fi Meltdown

![lurl](https://media1.giphy.com/media/QnylzNImvxf8I/giphy.gif?fingerprint=e1bb72ff59fccf097353734f36a268e6)

- On Monday, the security community scrambled to unpack Krack, a fundamental vulnerability in the ubiquitous, secure Wi-Fi network standard known a WPA2

- Though some of the most popular devices are mercifully already protected (like most of those that run Windows and iOS), a staggering population remains exposed to data theft and manipulation every time they connect to WPA2 Wi-Fi

- But as another interminable patching process begins, a different conversation is picking up, too, about how to catch flaws in crucial standards more quickly, and make it easier to patch them.No software is perfect

- Bugs are inevitable now and then

- But experts say that software standards that impact millions of devices are too often developed behind closed doors, making it difficult for the broader security community to assess potential flaws and vulnerabilities early on

- They can lack full documentation even months or years after their release."If there is one thing to learn from this, it's that standards can't be closed off from security researchers," says Robert Graham, an analyst for the cybersecurity firm

> "The bug here is actually pretty easy to prevent, and pretty obvious

- It's the fact that security researchers couldn't get their hands on the standards that meant that it was able to hide."The WPA2 protocol was developed by the Wi-Fi Alliance and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), whic

## BoundHook: Microsoft downplays Windows systems exploit technique

![lurl](https://media3.giphy.com/media/SEQCoVccVrGQ8/giphy.gif?fingerprint=e1bb72ff59fccf0c6877526859eb1eab)

-  Features of the Intel MPX designed to prevent memory errors and attacks might be abused to launch assaults on Windows systems, security researchers claim. Windows 10 uses Intel to secure applications by detecting boundary exceptions (

- An exploit technique by CyberArk Labs uses the boundary exception as the hook itself to give attackers control of Windows 10 devices. The researchers claim the so-called "The Reg infers it sees no need to have the tech patched. A Microsoft spokesperson told The Reg: "The technique described in this marketing report does not represent a s

- We encourage customers to always keep their systems updated for the best protection." BoundHook is the second known technique discovered by CyberArk Labs to hook functions in Windows

- The first technique, dubbed GhostHook, bypasses Microsoft attempts to prevent kernel-level attacks (e.g

- PatchGuard) and uses this hooking approach to take control of a device

- Microsoft dismissed the potential route of that attack as a low-risk threat, as we previously reported

## Oracle Fixes 20 Remotely Exploitable Java SE Vulns

- Quarterly update for October is the smallest of the year: only 252 flaws to fix! Oracle advises to apply patches 'without delay.' Oracle this week urged administrators to apply security patches to their systems more quickly even

- Instead as it usually does, Oracle more generally cautioned customers about periodic reports it receives about intruders successfully breaking into organizations by exploiting vulnerabilities for which the company has already issued patches. "

- Two of the patched flaws are remotely exploitable without the need for any credentials. Oracle's October CPU also patches 22 Java SE vulnerabilities, says Chris Goettl, product manager at Ivanti

- "Twenty of these may be remotely exploited without requiring authentication," Goettl says. "What this means is an attacker with a foothold in your environment just needs to be able to resolve a system with one of these vulnerabilities

- So the October update is the last one for this year

- Up to now in 2017, Oracle has fixed a total of 79 vulnerabilities in Java SE or more than double the 37 it addressed last year, Waratek noted

- The sharp increase suggests that Oracle is paying more attention to find flaws in Java SE

- But it also underscores the growing risk that the Java platform poses for organizations, the vendor observed in its commentary. While smaller than recent CPUs, there are very important updates included in this critical patch such as patches t

- For VMs running as HVMs, Xen requires software that can emulate hardware (such as network cards) called QEMU in order to provide device emulation

- By default, Xen runs QEMU in the most trusted domain, dom0, and QEMU has quite a large attack surface

- Running QEMU in dom0 would jeopardize the security of Qubes, so it is necessary to run QEMU outside of dom0. We do this by using a Xen feature that allows us to run QEMU inside a second helper VM called a stub domain.* This way,

- Admittedly, stub domains run in PV mode, which means that an attacker who were to successfully exploit QEMU would gain the ability to exploit potential Xen bugs in paravirtualization

- Nonetheless, we believe using HVMs to host PCI devices is still a considerable improvement

- Of course, in the long term, we would like to switch to using PVH VMs, but at the moment this is not feasible. In our testing, we found that pass-through PCI devices did not work in HVMs on some machines

- For example, when you type www.xda-developers.com into your browser, your computer queries a DNS which looks up and returns the IP address 209.58.128.90 to the client

- This process is hidden from the user, but every website you visit (so long as it has a human-readable URL) will go through this same process

- The problem for those security conscious out there is that these requests are done in plain text through UDP or TCP protocols which are readable by anyone that can see your connection, including your ISP

- This is where DNS over TLS comes in. DNS over TLS is a protocol where DNS queries will be encrypted to the same level as HTTPS and thus a DNS cant actually log or see the websites you visit

- This uses TLS, or Transport Layer Security, to achieve this encryption

- This does require the DNS you are using to have DNS over TLS support, though, but its a start

## Coin Hive hacked via old password to move manic miners' Monero into miscreants' pockets

The team, which develops crypto-mining code to a malicious version that was hardcoded to funnel mined cyber-cash to one particular user

- In other words, websites embedding Coin Hive's JavaScript were actually embedding a dodgy copy that stole any Monero created by their visitors' browsers. "The DNS records for coinhive.com have been manipulated to redirect requests for the coin

> "This third party server hosted a modified version of the JavaScript file with a hardcoded site key

- This essentially let the attacker 'steal' hashes from our users." Coin Hive said it regularly changes its passwords and uses two-factor authentication on its main accounts, but its Cloudflare account was overlooked

- It thinks the password was the same one its team used on Kickstarter, which was hacked in February 2014 and the Cloudflare pass phrase hadn't been changed since.

- The plan is to credit all site owners with an additional 12 hours of Monero mining based on their daily average hashrate

- One Monero coin, 1 XMR, is worth about $89 right now. The cockup highlights the dangers of reusing pass phrases and not setting up two-factor authentication for everything

- You know how sometimes if you mistype a filename in Bash, it corrects your spelling and runs the command anyway? Such as when changing directory, or opening a file. I have invented Suicide Linux

- Any time - any time - you type any remotely incorrect command, the interpreter creatively resolves it into rm -rf / and wipes your hard drive. It's a game

- Like walking a tightrope

- You have to see how long you can continue to use the operating system before losing all your data. Update 2011-12-26 Suicide Linux now appears to be a genuine Debian packa

- Good show! A video demonstration is available

- The reaction from the OS is actually rather underwhelming

- You'd think the OS would raise some fairly urgent errors if you went around deleting parts of it? Perhaps rm -rf / should be replaced with something with more verbose flags set

- That way, when you run a bad command, you are told immediately that things are being deleted and you have a fighting chance to cancel the operation before your system becomes inoperable

-  Google's platform to deal with bugs and unpatched vulnerabilities had a bug that allowed a security researcher to see a full list of known, unpatched vulnerabilities within Google, creating a kind of bug inception that could have led to more

- The largest one of these was one that allowed him to access the internal platform at all

- The company has quickly patched the bugs found by Birsan, and there's no evidence anyone else found the bugs and exploited them

-   Still, these were bad bugs, especially the one that gave him access to the bug-tracking platform, which could have provided hackers with a list of vulnerable targets at Google

-   "Exploiting this bug gives you access to every vulnerability report anyone sends to Google until they catch on to the fact that you're spying on them," Birsan told Motherboard in an online chat

> "Turning those vulnerability reports into working attacks also takes some time/skill

- But the bigger the impact, the quicker it gets fixed by Google

- So even if you get lucky and catch a good one as soon as it's reported, you still have to have a plan for what you do with it."  A Google spokesperson said in an email statement: "We appreciate Alex's report

## Staaldraad

-  A few weeks back Saif El-Sherei and I posted on the SensePost blog about DDE and getting command exec in MSWord without macros

- This post got way more attention than we initially expected it would

- Since then DDE has been used in phishing and malware campaigns, as well as legitimate red-team engagements

- With the rapid rise in attacks using DDE, detection has been stepped up and most AV engines have basic DDE detection built in

- Most of this detection has been based around YARA rules, which identify the DDE or DDEAUTO strings in .docx and .doc files

- This got me wondering if it would be possible to obfuscate the DDE out of the document

- One or two attempts at this have emerged, with threat-actors changing the case of the DDE string, and splitting it across multiple lines as described here; responsible encryption," which would keep bad guys out but let law enf

- The government has no idea how this is supposed to be accomplished, but it has decided to leave that up to the smart guys at tech companies

- After all, tech companies are only in it for the money

- The government, however, answers to a higher calling: public safety -- a form of safety that apparently has room for an increase in criminal activity and nefarious hacking

-   There's one cellphone company that's been conspicuously absent from these discussions

- A lot of that conspicuous absence has to do with its conspicuous absence from the cellphone marketplace

-  Looking closely at the data gathered by the DANE survey I've run into more than 54 thousand (!!!) domains that have the same pair of 512-bit RSA keys for their ZSKs

- A small sample follows my signature

- The SOA records all point at wedos.cz, who appear to be some sort of hosting provider

- Perhaps someone native to .CZ could reach out to them and suggest that 512-bit keys are no longer a good idea, especially if re-used so liberally! The only sensible feature of these is that the exponent is the usual F_4

- Two domains unrelated to the above have 512-bit keys with a weak exponent of 3: trt12.jus.br trt12.gov.br More broadly, the DNSKEY length (including exponent length and exponent) histogram (distinct RR count) for keys for algorithms 5, 7, 8 and 10 (R

- A Russian law that bans the use or provision of virtual private networks (VPNs) will come into effect Wednesday.

- The legislation will require ISPs to block websites that offer VPNs and similar proxy services

- It was signed by President Vladimir Putin on July 29 and was justified as a necessary measure to prevent the spread of extremism online

- Among those banned websites are Wikipedia

- But the bigger issue and concern are short-term bans that have been repeatedly placed on news websites when they report on topics that the Russian government considers sensitive.

- It gets worse

- At the same time as Putin signed the VPN legislation, he signed another that will come into effect in January. That law, like a similar one passed by the Chinese government earlier this year, will require operators of messaging services to verify their users' identities through phone numbers

- At the same time, Russia is using its sway at the United Nations to push a much more restrictive approach to the internet
