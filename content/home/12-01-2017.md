NOTE: This month will be at RIT's GCCIS building room 1400. That's Building 070 GOL-1400. You can park in the lot closest to the building without a permit. See [RIT Parking Page](https://www.rit.edu/fa/parking/parking) for more specific information.  

Wow. Big month. It'll be a a very serious discussion about the
information divide as we complain about problems of cryptography and
headphones . I appologize in advance for the following talks:

* Antitree: This month in infosec
* Joe: SSH'ing on your parade
* Antitree: Reports from the Radical Left
* Antitree: Put this in your pip and smoke it
