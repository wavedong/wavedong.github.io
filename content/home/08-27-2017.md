For thos interested, the meeting this month is a slap in the face of
dissapointment while we open up the forums to discuss a deeply sad
comparison between Brian and nose hair . Here are the actual talks this
month:

* Someone: This month in infosec
* Some Other guy: Look at me! Tizen!
* Sum Guy: Let's get Quantum Physical
