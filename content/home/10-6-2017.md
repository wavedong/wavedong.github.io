The First Friday 2600 meeting will be a time for awkward lack of eye
contact as we chat about the state of infosec and its negative affect on
the economy and talk about an oversimplified comparative anlaysis of
mobile cybers and Washington . I appologize in advance for the following
talks:

* Someone: This month in infosec
* Dr. Robo Alex: Let's get Quantum Physical
* Cowboy Joe: SSHH... don't tell anyone yet
