## Equifax's CEO isn't sure whether they've finally started encrypting their servers yet

-      Equifax's nation-destroying data-breach was subsequently revealed to be just the latest in a series

-     The admission came at this week's Congressional Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation hearings on "Protecting Consumers in the Era of Major Data Breaches." That's where disgraced former CEO Richard Smith told Senato

- When pressed to say whether the data is encrypted now, interim CEO Paulino do Rego Barros Jr said, "I don't know at this stage."  Smith added, "It's a more modern environment with multiple layers of security that did not exist before

- Encryption is only one of those layers of security."   Gardner moved on to Barros and asked whether he has implemented encryption for data at rest since he took over the position on Sept

- 26

-  Barros began to answer by saying that Equifax has done a "top-down review" of its security, but Gardner interrupted, saying it was a yes or no question

- Barros stumbled again and said it was being reviewed as part of the response process and Gardner pushed again

-  "Yes or no, does the data remain unencrypted at rest?"  "I don't know at this stage," Barros responded

- Each of them allows local users to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impacts initiated from a crafted USB device

- A few of the flaws can be exploited to execute code in the kernel. Konovalov initially reported the first of the 79 bugs last December via a Google Groups mailing list

- He continued updating the group with new findings throughout this year

- Among those he notified were Google, Linux kernel developers, Intel and The Linux Foundation. "Some of the issues simply freeze or cause a system to reboot, which is potentially less damaging," sai

## Linux sandboxing improvements in Firefox 57

![lurl](https://media3.giphy.com/media/11V1tYGpdMVlZe/giphy.gif?cid=e1bb72ff5a21e4b76573683945a56ba1)

-  Firefox 57 not only ships a large amount of performance improvements and a UI refresh, it also contains a number of technological improvements under the hood

- One of these is that the security sandbox was tightened, making it harder for attackers - should they find a security hole in Firefox in the first place - to escalate that attack against the rest of the system, or your data.  The content proc

- Notably, it is no longer possible to read private information in the home directory or the Firefox user profile, even if Firefox were to be compromised.  We could not block the web content rendering entirely from reading the filesystem becaus

- Rather than postpone the security improvements till this is reworked, we've elected to work around this by allowing a few very specific locations through

- Similar things apply to the use of PulseAudio (to be fixed around Firefox 59 with a new Rust based audio backend), ffmpeg (media decoding must stay sandboxed) and WebGL.  We've made sure this works on all common, and many not-so common config

- So most of you can stop reading here, but for those who like to know more details or are tinkerers, the following might be of interest

- Due to the infinite configurability of Linux systems, it's always possible there will be cases where a non-standard setup can break things, and we've kept Firefox configurable, so you can at least help yourself, if you're so inclined.  For ex

- 0 disables everything, 1 filters dangerous system calls, 2 additionally blocks writing to the filesystem, and 3 adds blocking of (most) reading from the filesystem

## Remote Code Execution in CouchDB (and Privilege Escalation in the Npm Registry)

![lurl](https://media2.giphy.com/media/vgUnnMiJPcvMQ/giphy.gif?cid=e1bb72ff5a21e4b84b49364c77eaec5c)

-  tl;dr There was a vulnerability in CouchDB caused by a discrepancy between the databases native JSON parser and the Javascript JSON parser used during document validation

- Because CouchDB databases are meant to be exposed directly to the internet, this enabled privilege escalation, and ultimately remote code execution, on a large number of installations

- If it had been exploited, this bug could have allowed for the modification of arbitrary packages in the npm registry. [edit: Im wrong, and the main npm registry is unaffected

- See correction below

- My bad!] CVE-2017-12635 Background Last time, I wrote about a deserialization bug leading to their homepage, the npm registry serves more than 3 billion (!) package downloads per week. CouchDB The npm registry uses CouchDB, which I hadnt heard of before this project

- The basic idea is that its a NoSQL database that makes data replication very easy

## This 10-year-old was able to unlock his moms iPhone using Face ID

![lurl](https://media3.giphy.com/media/3tADSHAqMml0s/giphy.gif?cid=e1bb72ff5a21e4b84b49364c771b1a2d)

- While Apple has admitted that false positives can happen, it was thought this could only happen

- However, a new video has popped up showing a 10-year-old unlocking his mothers iPhone, suggesting that any family members who bear enough resemblance might be able to bypass the system. In the video, the mother explains that despite setting u

- A Wired report on the video notes that the son was able to do this upon picking up the phone for the first time

- The son was also able to unlock his fathers phone, but only in one instance. After the mother reregistered her face under different lighting, her son was no longer able to unlock her phone

- She reregistered a third time in dimmer lighting to replicate her initial registration, and then, her son was able to unlock the phone again. Although Apple says Face ID is more secure than Touch ID, this raises questions about the possibility

- It is possible that the sons age played a role as Apple has said that the undeveloped facial features in those under the age of 13 could cause issues with Face ID. Weve reached out to Apple for comment and will update with a response.

## Lock it up! New hardware protections for your lock screen with the Google Pixel 2

![lurl](https://media0.giphy.com/media/OTnDHCCFNZHwc/giphy.gif?cid=e1bb72ff5a21e4b937612f625549aaa1)

-   Posted by Xiaowen Xin, Android Security Team The new Google Pixel 2 ships with a dedicated hardware security module designed to be robust against physical attacks

- This hardware module performs lockscreen passcode verification and protects your lock screen better than software alone.  To learn more about the new protections, lets first review the role of the lock screen

- Enabling a lock screen protects your data, not just against casual thieves, but also against sophisticated attacks

- Many Android devices, including all Pixel phones, use your lockscreen passcode to derive the key that is then used to encrypt your data

- Before you unlock your phone for the first time after a reboot, an attacker cannot recover the key (and hence your data) without knowing your passcode first

- To protect against brute-force guessing your passcode, devices running Android 7.0+ verify your attempts in a secure environment that limits how often you can repeatedly guess

- Only when the secure environment has successfully verified your passcode does it reveal a device and user-specific secret used to derive the disk encryption key.  Benefits of tamper-resistant hardware The goal of these protections

- Performing these types of security-critical operations in tamper-resistant hardware significantly increases the difficulty of attacking it.    See the full report here.   agenda here.  Dark Reading's Quick Hits delivers a brief synopsis and summary of the significance o

- The version of the browser coming out today has a sleek new interface and, under the hood, major performance enhancements, with Mozilla claiming that it's as much as twice as fast as it was a year ago

- Not only should it be faster to load and render pages, but its user interface should remain quick and responsive even under heavy load with hundreds of tabs. Collectively, the performance work being done to modernize Firefox is called back when Firefox 57 hit the developer channel in September, but the short version is, Mozilla is

- First, the Web has changed since many parts of Firefox were initially designed and developed; pages are more dynamic in structure and applications are richer and more graphically intensive

- JavaScript is also more complex and difficult to debug

- Second, computers now have many cores and simultaneous threads, giving them much greater scope to work in parallel

- And security remains a pressing concern, prompting the use of new techniques to protect against exploitation

- The team took less than a week to apparently crack Cupertino's vaunted new security mechanism, demonstrating that miscreants can potentially unlock a phone with a mask of the owner's face.    After registering a person's face on the phone  and the handset should only unlock when it sees this face  the team built a 3D printed mask of the test subject using an off-the-she

- One of the reasons was that the Chrome engineers saw that a change was happening in hardware and they started making better use of that new hardware. 

- These CPUs had multiple cores which meant that they could do tasks independently of each other, but at the same timein parallel. This can be tricky though

- With parallelism, you can introduce subtle bugs that are hard to see and hard to debug

## Parsing Untrusted File Formats Safely

-  (Formerly known as Puffs: Parsing Untrusted File Formats Safely). Wuffs is a domain-specific language and library for wrangling untrusted file format

- Wrangling includes parsing, decoding and encoding

- Examples of such file formats include images, audio, video, fonts and compressed archives. Unlike the C programming language, Wuffs is safe with respect to buffer overflows, integer arithmetic overflows and null pointer dereferences

- The key difference between Wuffs and other memory-safe languages is that all such checks are done at compile time, not at run time

- If it compiles, it is safe, with respect to those three bug classes. The aim is to produce software libraries that are as safe as Go or Rust, roughly speaking, but as fast as C, and that can be used anywhere C libraries are used

- This includes very large C/C++ products, such as popular web browsers and operating systems (using that term to include desktop and mobile user interfaces, not just the kernel). The trade-off in aiming for both safety and speed is that Wuffs p

- A statement like x += 1 unsurprisingly means to increment the variable x by 1

- However, in Wuffs, such a statement is a compile time error unless the compiler can also prove that x is not the maximal value of x's type (e.g

- Quad9 blocks phishing sites that are flagged as malicious, he notes. DNS attacks can be insidious for consumers as well as businesses

- Three out of 10 companies say they've been hit with cyberattacks on their DNS infrastructure, 93% of whom suffered downtime due to the attack, according to a recent study by Dimensional Research on behalf of Infoblox

- And that's just the organizations who actually detected that their DNS was hit; experts believe the actual number of DNS attacks is higher because many organizations don't know. Quad9 isn't the first free DNS service, however

- OpenDNS, now part of Cisco Systems as OpenDNS Home, was one of the first such services that filters malicious DNS traffic, for example, and Google offers its 8.8.8.8

-  DNS pioneer Paul Vixie, CEO and founder of DNS security firm FarSight Security, notes that there are actually hundreds of freebie DNS services, and not all are created equal

> "There are hundreds of DNS service providers offering free service, but the only ones I'm sure I would trust to see my DNS lookups are Google's 8.8.8.8 and Cisco Umbrella's OpenDNS

- And now, add DCA/PCH/IBM's Quad9 to that list, because their credentials are also quite strong." While Google's 8.8.8.8 does not filter DNS responses, Cisco Umbrella's OpenDNS and Quad9 filter "any known-dangerous DNS data that could otherwise

- Blockchain SecurityThere are endless articles detailing every single hack that occurred by exploiting smart contracts

- One of the greatest flaws in the smart contract technology is that they cannot be updated

- Once they are on the blockchain they are written in stone, they cannot be changed

- If the contract is vulnerable, it will stay that way.A smart contract, being code, is prone to vulnerabilities

- Even though there are multiple solid attempts to make the ICO contract development easier and more secure like OpenZeppelin, ConsenSys etc

- your developers can always make mistakes

- Its not bad to make mistakes, but it is bad to deploy your contract without going through a security assessment.Due diligence should be made by the development team

- By no means should you leave the smart contract development to just one person

- Conceived to raise awareness about the threat of device fingerprinting, Panopticlick was extended in December 2015

- This new update adds a test for trackers whitelisted by the so-called "Acceptable Ads" initiative

- Acceptable Ads is a program involving the popular adblockers Adblock Plus and Adblock, whereby companies can have their ads deemed "acceptable" if they meet certain format criteria

- These ads are then unblocked and any company operating above a certain threshold must agree to pay Eyeo, the owner of Adblock Plus, a fee of  for administering the process

- This revenue is divided between the participating ad blockers.  By default, Panopticlick will now check browsers for trackers from the Acceptable Ads list by testing against a real tracker

- If the browser fails, that tracker will receive some information about the user, but this minimal leakage is necessary to diagnose the problem

- If you are uncomfortable with this, it is possible to opt out of the test

- We love encryption

- Encryption works

- With relatively little effort, anyone can scramble a file so well that no one will ever be able to decrypt it unless they're provided with the key. Let's say this is Netflix

- They send you a movie that's been scrambled and they want to be sure you can't save it and watch it later from your hard-drive

- But they also need to give you a way to view the movie, too

- At some point, that means unscrambling the movie

- In this case, DNS Exfiltration can even be used to exfiltrate data out of an isolated VPC if AWS' managed DNS infrastructure is not disabled. DNS Exfiltration can occur when an internal DNS server is configured to forward external requests to

- AWS allows the use of their preconfigured DNS infrastructure (named AmazonProvidedDNS) by default in all VPCs

- An attacker can utilize this channel to send and receive data with servers outside of the allowed environment

- AWS Customers can mitigate this risk by using their own DNS server and turning off the preconfigured use of Amazon's DNS infrastructure. How DNS Works To understand how DNS Exfiltration work, it is necessary to understand how DNS work

- If you already know this,  In many organizations, a network will have port 53(DNS) outbound blocked on the firewall and instead, would have an internal DNS server to resolve external domains

-  Websites Use Session-Replay Scripts to Eavesdrop on Every Keystroke and Mouse Movement The security researchers at Princeton are The stated purpose of this data collection includes gathering insights into how users interact with websites and discovering broken or confusing pages

- However the extent of data collected by these services far exceeds user expectations; text typed into forms is collected before the user submits the form, and precise mouse movements are saved, all without any visual indication to the user

- This data can't reasonably be expected to be kept anonymous

- In fact, some companies allow publishers to explicitly decryption key for Apples Secure Enclave Processor (SEP) firmware Posted Online by self-described ARM64 pornstar [xerub]

- SEP is the security co-processor introduced with the iPhone 5s which is when touch ID was introduced

- Its a black box that were not supposed to know anything about but [xerub] has now pulled back the curtain on that. The secure enclave handles the processing of fingerprint data from the touch ID sensor and determines if it is a match or not

- The SEP is a gatekeeper which prevents the main processor from accessing sensitive data

- The processor sends data which can only be read by the SEP which is authenticated by a session key generated from the devices shared key

- It also runs on its own OS [SEPOS] which has a kernel, services drivers and apps

- The SEP performs secure services for the rest of the SOC and much more which you can learn about from the Demystifying the Secure Enclave Processor talk at Blackhat [xerub] img4lib and xerubs SEP firmware split tool to process
